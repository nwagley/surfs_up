# Surf's Up

## Overview 
The overview of this assignemnt was to gather data for W.Avy and find out the analysis of the temperature trends. He asked us to get the temperature data from the months of June and December
in the city of Oahu, Hawaii. He needs this data in order to see if his new surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable all year long. 

## Results 
June

We can see that see after looking at the above table in june that the average temperature was

In December when we look at the above temperature from the data we pulled, the average temperature
was 71 degrees with the minimum going down to 56 and the max reaching 83 degrees.


## Summary 
While looking at both the data from above when asked the question if the resturant can operate year round, we would be slightly hesitant in the case of december but the data shows us that even in demceber the coldest day in the city is 56 degrees which is still luke warm , thus the shop will have no problem getting customers year round
